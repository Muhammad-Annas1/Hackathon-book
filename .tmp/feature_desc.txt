Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Target audience: Students learning Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
Focus: ROS 2 middleware, rclpy control, and URDF for humanoids.
Chapters (3–4):
1. ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services
2. Controlling robots with rclpy (Python -> ROS bridge)
3. URDF fundamentals for humanoid robots
4. (Optional) Simple humanoid joint control project
Success criteria:
- Accurate ROS 2 concepts and runnable examples
- Valid rclpy scripts and URDF files
- Docusaurus-ready markdown
Constraints:
- ROS 2 Humble+ compatibility
- Use only ROS 2 concepts (no Gazebo/Isaac/Unity)
Not building:
- Full navigation, SLAM, or simulation features
